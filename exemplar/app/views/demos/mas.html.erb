  We explain what you need to know about Help to Buy - the government's schemes aimed at first-time buyers with low deposits and current owners with limited equity.
</p>

<h2>Test H2 heading</h2>
<p>Help to Buy - the two main schemes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Equity loans</strong> - the government lends you up to a fifth of the value of a new-build home in England. A similar equity loan scheme is available in Scotland, for properties valued up to £400,000.</li>
  <li><strong>Mortgage guarantees</strong> - the government agrees to cover part of your mortgage if you only have a small deposit, taking on the default risk should you fall behind with payments.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2>DID YOU KNOW?</h2>

  <p>In 1985, average first-time buyers needed a deposit of 5% to buy a home - in 2012, this had increased to 20%

<p>Help to Buy is expected to help make up for the lack of higher loan-to-value products available.</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test three</p>

<p>While it’s still occasionally possible for people with a deposit of only 5% to get on the property ladder, the government felt there should be more competition between mortgage lenders to provide greater choice to home buyers.</p>
